- install HomeBrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

Once Homebrew is installed, you can update PHP by running:

brew update
brew install php

Install a Local Server:
You can use MAMP (free version available) which simplifies the setup of Apache, MySQL, and PHP. Download it from https://www.mamp.info and follow the installation instructions.
Configure Document Root:
By default, MAMP sets the document root to /Applications/MAMP/htdocs. You can place your PHP project there or configure a new document root through MAMP’s preferences to point to your project’s directory.
Start the Server:
Open MAMP and start the servers. MAMP will then start Apache and MySQL.
Run Your PHP Project:
Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:8888 if you are using the default MAMP ports. If your project is in a subfolder, append the folder name to the URL (e.g., http://localhost:8888/yourprojectfolder).
Database (if needed):
If your project requires a database, use MAMP's built-in phpMyAdmin to manage your MySQL databases. You can access it at http://localhost:8888/phpMyAdmin.
Additional Configuration:
If you need to edit php.ini, you can find it inside the /Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php[version]/conf/php.ini, where [version] is your PHP version.
